# Filename: GScholarXScraper.R
# Author: Kay Cichini
# Licence: Original was non-commercial, so this will be the same.
# Modified by: Tony Breyal
# Contributations: Philipp Riemer - improvements to the xpathLVApply function code, see http://tonybreyal.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/web-scraping-yahoo-search-page-via-xpath/#comment-45
# Description: Returns a wordcloud for a Google Scholar web search based on a given field e.g. "title", "description", etc.
# Notes: This is Kay Cichini's function but I modified it to use XPath expressions via the XML package instead of regular expresions alone. I also added some vectorisation, word stemming and restructured the function to make it easier for me to read.
