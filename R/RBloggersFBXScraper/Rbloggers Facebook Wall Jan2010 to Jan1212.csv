 gamma distribution has been illustrated in time durations, this paper 
lays down a base for Time Topology from philosophical, historical and 
statistical perspective. This opens up a bigger Cartesian debate that 
how can both Y axis and X axis (assuming 2 D Topology) have patterns. 
Pattern on Y axis is bound to conflict with the pattern on the X axis. 
Moreover, the symmetry overlap in natural systems is so conspicuous, 
that the hidden mysterious force or law of nature seems to be time. The 
Maple leaf symmetry cannot be both in x axis common time and y axis 
natural systems. Assuming this is true, Plato’s view of Time would 
prevail on Aristotle’s view of time. Time Topology would also stand to 
strengthen the subject of intertemporal choices in the future evolution 
of society. Time Topology at a 2D level is a head and shoulder pattern, 
which is mirrored by every natural system. Time Topology could also be 
the reason for overwhelming exponentiality around us. And why it’s 
really not a surprise that the universe is accelerating (Nobel Prize 
2011), because accelerating time creates accelerating space 
(accelerating entropy).","http://www.r-bloggers.com/fractals-in-r/","Atte

 forgot Pascal. It's an excellent beginner's language and feeds into R 
and C. Pascal teaches arrays in a simpler fashion than R and C, doesn't 
have the dataframe/zoo complexity better saved for advanced users, and

 much as I like R, my answer is a strong NO. The simpler and clearer a 
language is, the better it is for learning the basics of programming. 
People should be aware of how things are organized in the background to 
understand what can go wrong and why some programs are slow and others 
are faster. They should learn about allocation and deallocation of 
memory, organization of structured data types, etc. R is too powerful, 
too tolerant, and has too much implicit behavior. Pascal is a good 
start, I agree, but it is not very wide spread anymore. Maybe C is a 
good compromise, though it can also be quite a dirty language.Friday, May 6, 2011 at 5:39pm · LikeUnlikeReplyLuis Javier Cota Of

 also played around with a few benchmarks. My impression is that, if the
 code is already well-done (e.g. making smart use of matrix operations),
 then the improvement is more or less zero. This is not surprising, but 
intuitively clear: if most of the time is spent in already optimized 
functions written in C, where should the improvement come from? Anything
 else would be illogical or Voodoo. To put it provocatively: the more 
improvement you observe when compiling a function, the lousier the 
uncompiled code was.Thursday, April 14, 2011 at 2:45pm · LikeUnlike ·  1Reply",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
